### Yet Another MOTD Plugin
Yet another plugin for displaying server MOTDs with Velocity.

> Why would I use this, when there are so many other plugins that do the same thing?  

*You shouldn't.*   

I (trainb0y) am making this to get a bit more experience with making proxy plugins, and because most other similar plugins have feature bloat:tm: that I don't want or need. I don't expect anyone else to ever need (or want) to use this. However, if you do, and run into any issues, I'll do my best to provide support.

### Features
- MiniMessage formatting   

...yeah, that's about it.
